    Parse the info about the field.

    However, the function doesn't do anything with it. Since the height of the field is
    hard-coded later, this bot won't work with maps of different height.

def parse_field(player: int):

    Parse the field.

    First of all, this function is also responsible for determining the next
    move. Actually, this function should rather only parse the field, and return
    it to another function, where the logic for choosing the move will be.

    Also, the algorithm for choosing the right move is wrong. This function
    finds the first position of _our_ character, and outputs it. However, it
    doesn't guarantee that the figure will be connected to only one cell of our
    territory. It can not be connected at all (for example, when the figure has
    empty cells), or it can be connected with multiple cells of our territory.
    That's definitely what you should address.

    Also, it might be useful to distinguish between lowecase (the most recent piece)
    and uppercase letters to determine where the enemy is moving etc.

    The input may look like this:
